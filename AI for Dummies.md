Transformer is a type of neural architecture and represents the Generative AI engine.
Neural Network is a network of processing nodes that uses algorithms to simulate the human brain.
[Include how neural network wors]
Transformers were develope by Google and the University of Toronto in 2017 to handle translation language in diffucult meaning contexts.

There are different type of Transformers mainly based on text, image or video.

Generative Pre-processing Transformer (GPT) at version 4 is the largest language model (LLM) in the world with more than 117 billion parameters. Parameters are numerical values that weight and define connection between node and layers in a neural network. Created by OpenAI is esimated 29 billions dollars even if it raised 11.3 billions dollars founds. it is owened 49% by microsoft, 49% Khosla Ventures, Reid Hoffman and others, 2% OpenAI non profit foundation. ChatGPT was launched on Nov 2022, it is an AI chatbot that leverage the advanced Natural Langua Processing (NLP). Reid Hoffman (Linkedin CEO) wrote in 2023 the book Impromptu https://lnkd.in/eZSsGYgB assisted by ChatGPT.

Dall-E is the GPT image generator.

Graphic processing unit (GPU) provided by Nvidia are designed for fast image rendering that is now commonly leveraged to process crunch of data simultaneously.  
Azure is the OpenAI cloud provider hosting GPU accellerated supercomputer with more that 285,000 GPUs Nvidia V100 and 400Gbps netowrking for each GPU server.
Model training was done on the cuDNN-accelerated PyTorch deep-learning framework. ChatGPT was trained on massive corpora taken from internet as it existed in 2021. Training data includes 570GB of datasets, including web pages, book and other sources. The initial model was also trained on data-fined tuned by human instructor: reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLFHF).
ChatGPT is integrated with Bing (Bing chat) and the Visual ChatGPT is a fusion of ChatGPT with a series of foundation model that permits to send, receive and edit images with chatting with AI in text.
GPT-3.5 is for free-tier users. Advanced GPT-4 is for premium users. Chat GPT plus costs 20 dollars/month.
